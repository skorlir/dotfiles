# [1] no_list_ambiguous
#     this means that, with node and node-gyp installed,
#       $ no<tab>
#     will expand to:
#       $ node
#     BUT instead of stopping, a menu shows for further disambiguation:
#       $ node
#         node node-gyp
#     with the default setting, list_ambiguous, <tab> must be pressed
#     again to continue completing and to eventually get node-gyp.

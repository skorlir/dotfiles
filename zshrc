# make ls colors consistent

# attributes for effects and 16 colors
#   fx 0{0=none  1=bold     2=dim     3=italic    4=underscore
#        5=blink 6=<unused> 7=reverse 8=concealed 9=strikeout}

#   bg 4{0=black 1=red 2=green 3=yellow 4=blue 5=magenta 6=cyan 7=white}
#
# NOTE that italic, concealed, and strikeout are not documented in
# console_codes and are not supported by all terminal emulators.
#
# additional codes 38 (fg) and 48 (bg) suppport 8- and 24-bit colors:
#   {38,48};5;x      -  8-bit  (256) color, x is in 0..255
#   {38,48};2;r;g;b  -  24-bit (rgb) color, each of r, g, b is in 0..255
#
# a complete escape is written:
#   [<parameters>m
# for example, a bright pastel-y purple:
#   [38;2;255;150;255m
#
# in zsh, codes can be tested using literal escape sequences in %{...%}:
#   print -P '%{[38;2;255;150;255m%}hello, purple!%{[0m%}'
